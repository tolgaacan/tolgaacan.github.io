                    As career experiences outside of business-related activities are
                    <br>
                    essential towards skill-building initiatives, I have participated
                    <br>
                    in various student groups and worked at early-stage startups which
                    <br>
                    were focused on educating and fostering commmunities in need of 
                    <br>
                    guidance relating to their corresponding fields of knowledge.
