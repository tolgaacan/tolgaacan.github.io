                    Between May and June 2020, I decided to take programming courses that
                    <br>
                    would better expand my knowledge of data science, and felt that the

                    After haven taken a series of workshops from the Ted Rogers School of Management,
                    <br>
                    I was inspired to build my own project which is currently in the works. The project in

                    of itself, is focused on taking large sums of data, and calculating how much an increased

                    level of activity with exercise is correlated with higher productivity towards studying.
                    <br>
                    The project was assisted on behalf of one of the instructors from my bootcamps, Jacob Dougherty,
                    <br>
                    whom assisted me with problem solving some of the programming. You may access the project or contribute

                    During February 2020, I decided that I wanted to get myself into
                    <br>
                    the general space of entrepeneurship, where I could practice teamwork
                    <br>
                    amongst others who were aiming to grow their communication skills. After
                    <br>
                    a lot of problem solving, and consulting ideas, our team reached 1st place
                    <br>
                    after proposing a entrepeural idea that would aim to solve the healthy food

                    In 2019, after the 10th year anniversary of Bitcoin, there were lots of
                    <br>
                    discussions about the topic of cryptocurrency, and how it was slowly beginning
                    <br>
                    to grasp the financial aspect of the world in both positive and negative aspects.
                    <br>
                    Inspired to learn more, 4 years after I decided to start up my own student organization,
                    <br>
                    focused on helping undergraduate students across the GTA learn more about the subject,
                    <br>
                    and to help get themselves prepared for the next generation of the internet. During late
                    <br>
                    August of 2023, I was also given the privilege of attending Toronto's biggest summer hackathon,
                    <br>
                    where I got to host a drop-in workshop explaining a general introduction to what blockchain

                    Starting in April 2021, I spent 8 months consulting a student group
                    <br>
                    about ways at which they could rebrand themselves to better fit the
                    <br>
                    interests of undergraduate students seeking time out of their studies
                    <br>
                    to learn video game development. I have worked on creating logo animations,
                    <br>
                    video workshops, and even ended up collaborating with the IEEE TMU student

                    Taking place remotely in Toronto, I was given the opportunity to
                    <br>
                    participate in a research assistant position at TMU for a game startup, where I was tasked
                    <br>
                    with picking a role that would help to develop a web game called Cognigeeks,
                    <br>
                    aimed towards helping STEM students in their secondary or postsecondary education
                    <br>
                    learn about electrical engineering. My main participations included
                    <br>
                    working with programmers to help implement UI design, writing story
                    <br>
                    and dialogue that would help build relatable characters that the
                    <br>
                    student can be educated by, facilitating voice acting sessions, and
                    <br>
                    using a Unity tool such as Rhubarb to help synchronize dialogue with
                    <br>
                    lip movements of cartoon characters. You can find the entire game here:

                    <br>
                    Back when I was studying in the Economics and Finance program at TMU,
                    <br>
                    I decided to consult another student group called IECONCU, on how they
                    <br>
                    could improve on their branding and community resources to better
                    <br>
                    reach first or second-year students who are seeking stronger guidance
                    <br>
                    when navigating the beginning of their university careers. The work
                    <br>
                    I've done included writing emails to promote case competitions hosted
                    <br>
                    by the student group itself, facilitating slide show queues during workshop
                    <br>
                    events, co-hosting case competitions with former colleagues from the SPROUT
                    <br>
                    organization where I won my award, building a website that garnered 3,500
                    <br>
                    total page views, as well as creating social media content to better engage
                    <br>
                    audiences of the platform. You may find my work here:

                    Between October 2019 and February 2020, I wanted to grow my networking
                    <br>
                    and participation skills by attending volunteer activities on the TMU
                    <br>
                    university campus. Starting with food centers across campus, I expanded
                    <br>
                    my volunteering skills and began helping out with Winter events, at which
                    <br>
                    I was helping with the setup of in-person activities such as skating rinks.
                    <br>
                    I have also received a recommendation letter for my voluntary work, which you

                    Starting out in my volunteer career, I felt at the time that it
                    <br>
                    would be worth it to attend activities relating to the shifting
                    <br>
                    scene in Canadian politics, hence why I decided to join the
                    <br>
                    TMU Student Democratic Exchange, where I attended activities
                    <br>
                    that would help to promote on-campus voting. After having volunteered
                    <br>
                    at art galleries, as well as handing out flyers to promote the groups
                    <br>
                    material, I learned a lot about how people can collaborate together
                    <br>
                    to support an important cause.

                    Throughout the summer of 2020, I decided to volunteer for the
                    <br>
                    known orientation crew at TMU, in order to help with content creation
                    <br>
                    as well as event facilitation. My experiences included hosting game
                    <br>
                    events during Zoom calls for a student count of 30 people, at which
                    <br>
                    I would create and source quizzes to students in order to get general
                    <br>
                    inquiries about how comfortable they feel on campus, and what their
                    <br>
                    mood was like on that particular day when attending certain events.
                    <br>
                    I was also helping with social media content creation, in order to better
                    <br>
                    spread messages about student initiatives on campus.
